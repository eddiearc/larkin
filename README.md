# Larkin

Larkin connects Codex, Claude Code, and Pi agent runtimes to Feishu. It provides a local runtime host, persistent sessions, reminders, interactive messages, and a local dashboard.

## Requirements

- A supported macOS or Linux system
- `lark-cli`
- At least one supported agent runtime and its authentication
- Bun 1.3.14 when building from source

## Usage

```bash
larkin setup
larkin start
larkin status
```

Run `larkin --help` or `larkin config --help` for the available commands and configuration options. Local configuration is stored under `~/.larkin` by default; set `LARKIN_CONFIG_DIR` to use another directory.

## Development

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun test
```

Use `bun run publication:check:tree` to verify the repository publication boundary and `bun run licenses:check` to verify the runtime-only third-party notice generator.
